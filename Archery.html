            <h5 class="card-title">Archery</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Archery is the art, sport, practice, or skill of using a bow to shoot arrows.[1] The
                word comes from the Latin arcus for bow.[2] Historically, archery has been used for hunting and combat.
                In modern times, it is mainly a competitive sport and recreational activity. A person who participates
                in archery is typically called an archer or a bowman, and a person who is fond of or an expert at
                archery is sometimes called a toxophilite or a marksman.[3]The oldest known evidence of arrows comes
                from the South African site of Sibudu Cave, where the remains of bone and stone arrowheads have been
                found dating approximately 60,000-70,000 years ago.[4][5][6][7][8] Based on indirect evidence, the bow
                also seems to have appeared or reappeared later in Eurasia, near the transition from the Upper
                Paleolithic to the Mesolithic. The earliest definite remains of bow and arrow from Europe are possible
                fragments from Germany found at Mannheim-Vogelstang dated 17,500-18,000 years ago, and at Stellmoor
                dated 11,000 years ago. Azilian points found in Grotte du Bichon, Switzerland, alongside the remains of
                both a bear and a hunter, with flint fragments found in the bear's third vertebra, suggest the use of
                arrows at 13,500 years ago.[9] Other signs of its use in Europe come from the Stellmoor [de] in the
                Ahrensburg valley [de] north of Hamburg, Germany and dates from the late Paleolithic, about 10,000–9000
                BC. The arrows were made of pine and consisted of a main shaft and a 15–20-centimetre-long (5 7⁄8–7 7⁄8
                in) fore shaft with a flint point. There are no definite earlier bows; previous pointed shafts are
                known, but may have been launched by spear-throwers rather than bows. The oldest bows known so far comes
                from the Holmegård swamp in Denmark. At the site of Nataruk in Turkana County, Kenya, obsidian bladelets
                found embedded in a skull and within the thoracic cavity of another skeleton, suggest the use of
                stone-tipped arrows as weapons about 10,000 years ago.[10] Bows eventually replaced the spear-thrower as
                the predominant means for launching shafted projectiles, on every continent except Australasia, though
                spear-throwers persisted alongside the bow in parts of the Americas, notably Mexico and among the Inuit.

                Bows and arrows have been present in Egyptian and neighboring Nubian culture since its respective
                predynastic and Pre-Kerma origins. In the Levant, artifacts that could be arrow-shaft straighteners are
                known from the Natufian culture, (c. 10,800–8,300 BC) onwards. The Khiamian and PPN A shouldered
                Khiam-points may well be arrowheads.

                Classical civilizations, notably the Assyrians, Greeks, Armenians, Persians, Parthians, Romans, Indians,
                Koreans, Chinese, and Japanese fielded large numbers of archers in their armies. Akkadians were the
                first to use composite bows in war according to the victory stele of Naram-Sin of Akkad.[11] Egyptians
                referred to Nubia as "Ta-Seti," or "The Land of the Bow," since the Nubians were known to be expert
                archers, and by the 16th Century BC Egyptians were using the composite bow in warfare.[12] The Bronze
                Age Aegean Cultures were able to deploy a number of state-owned specialized bow makers for warfare and
                hunting purposes already from the 15th century BC.[13] The Welsh longbow proved its worth for the first
                time in Continental warfare at the Battle of Crécy.[14] In the Americas archery was widespread at
                European contact.[15]

                Archery was highly developed in Asia. The Sanskrit term for archery, dhanurveda, came to refer to
                martial arts in general. In East Asia, Goguryeo, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea was well known for
                its regiments of exceptionally skilled archers.[16][17]</p>
